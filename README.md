CS 360 Final Project Budget Live Web App

#### Project Details:
Tracking spending can be troublesome, and keeping receipts can be a hassle to 
determine how much exactly was spent on different things such as food, bills, and dates.
This idea is to allow a personalized budget to made where a user can enter their 
transactions, create a budget for different categories ( food, bills, etc..), have a total 
budget, and see a percentage spent within the budget. They can view their information 
in different time frames such as months and years, or even daily. The site will have a 
REST API so that eventually a mobile application can be built.
There can be multiple users linked to the same account where all transactions will be 
traced back to the committer and show in what category a user is spending in.
